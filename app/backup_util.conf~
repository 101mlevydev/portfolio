#configuration file for Backup Utility
#
#this configuration file allows you to specify the files that will be backed up
#
#to add files to the backup list:
#1. Enter the full path of each file you want to backup on a seperate line
#2. Make sure each file path is accurate and point to an existing file
#3. ensure that there are no leading or trailing spaces in the file path
#
#
#for example
#/etc/hosts
#/etc/resolv.conf
#
#
#each line should contain a single file path. you can add as many files as you w
ant.

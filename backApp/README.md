welcme to my backApp!

this is an app that backs up files to your request.

after installing via dnf, you should go into the /opt/backup_util and configure the configuration file to your needs. each line should have the full path for the file you want to backup. then run the python script.

the file backs up /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf by default
